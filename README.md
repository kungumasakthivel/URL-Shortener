# URL Shortener using Bitly API

This URL shortener is helpful to short lengter url into shorter form to share with people. So the longer url doesn't mess up your text message or email with link.

Here I developed this webpage using React with Bitly API to shorten the URL. So I also used some `npm` packages for fetching data, error message popup's and also for loder.

* axios
* react-toastify
* react-loader-spinner

These packages are used to enhance the web-page functionality.
